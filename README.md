# ParkingDataVisualization

Geoinformation in Society project at the ifgi in M端nster: Visualization of parking data in M端nster

## View the app [here](https://gins.christian-terbeck.de/).


We intend to visualize data of parking lots in M端nster.
Two user groups can benefit from our application: 
1) Car drivers who want to find the best parking solution
2) Analysts can look at occupancy of parking lots - this may be helpful for city planners or simply citienzens that are interested in parking statistics

We have divided our application into four components. The main component is the map that visualizes the location of the parking lots in M端nster. On a side bar we have a chart components that visualizes statistics of the occupancy with line, bar and pie charts. Below that a overview table gives detailed semantic information about each parking lot. Each of the components are intended to interact with each other, so that the user's interaction on one component also have an effect on the others. With a temporal slider the user can change the time and weekday where the visualized data should be related to.
The app should also work on a mobile device so that a car driver can plan their trip according to their current position and desired destination (Please don't use the app while driving!).
